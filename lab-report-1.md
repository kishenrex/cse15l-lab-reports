#Installing VS Code

I already had VS Code installed as I took CSE11 last quarter, so I could skip this step. However, if I had to reinstall it, I would go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download the installer for windows.

#Remotely Connecting

First I downloaded Git for Windows from https://gitforwindows.org/, selecting VS Code as my default text editor. Then I opened a terminal in VS Code and inputted the 
```
$ ssh cs15lwi23ask@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
command.

Note that I do not need to type in the $ into the terminal.

Then, I typed "yes" to continue connecting. Note that this should only happen once and not everytime I try to connect, as it might indicate somebody else is snooping.
